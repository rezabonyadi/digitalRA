		"abstract": "Survivors of pediatric central nervous system (CNS) tumors are at risk for neurocognitive and social difficulties throughout childhood. This study characterized social cognition (perception and reasoning from social cues) and adjustment in adulthood. A total of 81 adult survivors of pediatric CNS tumors (51% female; mean [SD] age, 28.0 [5.8] years), were recruited across four groups: (1) no radiation therapy (RT) [n = 21], (2) infratentorial (IT) tumors + focal RT [n = 20], (3) IT tumors + craniospinal irradiation [n = 20], and (4) supratentorial tumors + focal RT [n = 20]. Prevalence of social cognitive and adjustment impairments was compared to test norms. Multivariable models examined clinical and neurocognitive predictors of social cognition and its impact on functional outcomes. Survivors demonstrated elevated risk of severe social cognitive impairments (social perception Morbidity Ratio [95% CI] 5.70 [3.46-9.20]), but self-reported few social adjustment problems. Survivors of IT tumors treated with craniospinal irradiation performed nearly 1 SD worse than survivors treated without RT on multiple measures of social cognition (e.g., social perception: β = -0.89, p = .004). Impaired executive functioning and nonverbal reasoning were associated with worse social cognitive performance (e.g., social perception: β = -0.75, p < .001; β = -0.84, p < .001, respectively). Better social perception was associated with higher odds of attaining full-time employment (odds ratio, 1.52 [1.17-1.97]) and at least some college education (odds ratio, 1.39 [1.11-1.74]). Adult survivors of CNS tumors are at elevated risk of severely impaired social cognition, but do not perceive social adjustment difficulties. Better understanding of potential mechanisms underlying social cognitive deficits may inform intervention targets to promote better functional outcomes for at-risk survivors.",

		"abstract": "The characterisation of autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) as an audio-visual phenomenon overlooks how tactile experiences are not just perceptual concurrents of ASMR (i.e., tingling) but also commonly strong ASMR inducers. Here we systematically investigated whether ASMR-responders show altered tactile processing compared to controls. Using a screening measure of vicarious touch with a predefined cut-off for mirror-touch synaesthesia (MTS; a condition where tactile sensations are experienced when viewing, but not receiving, touch), we found that ASMR-responders had more frequent and intense vicarious touch experiences, as well as a strikingly higher incidence of MTS, than non-responders. ASMR-responders also reported greater reactivity to positive, but not negative, interpersonal touch. Correlations further showed these patterns to be more prevalent in those responders with stronger ASMR. We discuss the implications of our findings in terms of heightened sensory sensitivity, bodily awareness, and the underlying neuro-cognitive mechanisms driving vicarious tactile perception in ASMR and MTS.",

		"abstract": "The neurocognitive mechanisms underlying autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remain unclear. Progress has been largely hampered by small sample sizes, variable age ranges and resulting inconsistent findings. There is a pressing need for large definitive studies to delineate the nature and extent of key case/control differences to direct research towards fruitful areas for future investigation. Here we focus on perception of biological motion, a promising index of social brain function which may be altered in ASD. In a large sample ranging from childhood to adulthood, we assess whether biological motion preference differs in ASD compared to neurotypical participants (NT), how differences are modulated by age and sex and whether they are associated with dimensional variation in concurrent or later symptomatology. Eye-tracking data were collected from 486 6-to-30-year-old autistic (N = 282) and non-autistic control (N = 204) participants whilst they viewed 28 trials pairing biological (BM) and control (non-biological, CTRL) motion. Preference for the biological motion stimulus was calculated as (1) proportion looking time difference (BM-CTRL) and (2) peak look duration difference (BM-CTRL). The ASD group showed a present but weaker preference for biological motion than the NT group. The nature of the control stimulus modulated preference for biological motion in both groups. Biological motion preference did not vary with age, gender, or concurrent or prospective social communicative skill within the ASD group, although a lack of clear preference for either stimulus was associated with higher social-communicative symptoms at baseline. The paired visual preference we used may underestimate preference for a stimulus in younger and lower IQ individuals. Our ASD group had a lower average IQ by approximately seven points. 18% of our sample was not analysed for various technical and behavioural reasons. Biological motion preference elicits small-to-medium-sized case-control effects, but individual differences do not strongly relate to core social autism associated symptomatology. We interpret this as an autistic difference (as opposed to a deficit) likely manifest in social brain regions. The extent to which this is an innate difference present from birth and central to the autistic phenotype, or the consequence of a life lived with ASD, is unclear.",

		"abstract": "Visuospatial perspective-taking (VPT) is a process of imagining what can be seen and how a scene looks from a location and orientation in space that differs from one's own. It comprises two levels that are underpinned by distinct neurocognitive processes. Level-2 VPT is often studied in relation to two other cognitive phenomena, object mental rotation (oMR) and theory of mind (ToM). With the aim to describe the broad picture of neurocognitive processes underlying level-2 VPT, here we give an overview of the recent behavioral and neuroscientific findings of level-2 VPT. We discuss its relation to level-1 VPT, which is also referred to as perspective-tracking, and the neighboring topics, oMR and ToM. Neuroscientific research shows that level-2 VPT is a diverse cognitive process, encompassing functionally distinct neural circuits. It shares brain substrates with oMR, especially those parietal brain areas that are specialized in spatial reasoning. However, compared to oMR, level-2 VPT involves additional activations in brain structures that are typically involved in ToM tasks and deal with self/other distinctions. In addition, level-2 VPT has been suggested to engage brain areas coding for internal representations of the body. Thus, the neurocognitive model underpinning level-2 VPT can be understood as a combination of visuospatial processing with social cognition and body schema representations.",

		"abstract": "Social cognition skills are typically acquired on the basis of visual information (e.g., the observation of gaze, facial expressions, gestures). In light of this, a critical issue is whether and how the lack of visual experience affects neurocognitive mechanisms underlying social skills. This issue has been largely neglected in the literature on blindness, despite difficulties in social interactions may be particular salient in the life of blind individuals (especially children). Here we provide a meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies reporting brain activations associated to the representation of self and others' in early blind individuals and in sighted controls. Our results indicate that early blindness does not critically impact on the development of the \"social brain,\" with social tasks performed on the basis of auditory or tactile information driving consistent activations in nodes of the action observation network, typically active during actual observation of others in sighted individuals. Interestingly though, activations along this network appeared more left-lateralized in the blind than in sighted participants. These results may have important implications for the development of specific training programs to improve social skills in blind children and young adults.",

		"abstract": "Facial expressions are the dominant way of human emotional and social communications. However, it remains unclear that how can perceivers extract emotion from the face. In the present study, we adopted a repetition-priming paradigm in combine with event-related potentials (ERP) to examine neurocognitive processing stages of facial expression perception. Results showed that emotional words were recognized faster than emotional faces, when both of which were primed by emotional faces, indicating the involvement of concepts processes in facial expression recognition. ERP results showed that all emotional faces could evoke responses of N170, while there was no significant difference between positive and negative emotional faces, suggesting that geometrical configurations of faces rather than emotional concepts of faces are processed at the stage of N170. In contrast, both emotional words and faces showed larger P2 in response to anger than happiness, which suggests that emotional concepts are extracted from faces at the stage of P2. To examine the underlying dynamic causal connectivity between facial structure and emotional conception, we conducted information flow analysis, which showed significant decreases of information flow from the fusiform gyrus to dorsal anterior cingulate cortex/dorsal medial prefrontal cortex and increases of information flow from the fusiform gyrus to posterior insula. These results revealed neural mechanisms underlying processes from physical structure to emotional concepts. Our findings suggest that facial expression recognition consists of two stages from geometrical structure of faces to emotional concepts of facial expressions, which provides evidence for facial expression processing and has important implications in the diagnosis and treatment of emotion recognition related disorders.",

		"abstract": "Individuals with schizophrenia have problems with visual contrast processing. The current study investigated contrast sensitivity (CS) in schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder to elucidate the underlying neural mechanisms affected by this disorder and to identify critical testing conditions that distinguish individuals with the disorder from healthy individuals. Principal component analysis was applied to the data (N = 143) to separate responses from distinct visual pathways. Participants were 68 patients and 75 age-similar controls. CS was obtained using a forced-choice psychophysical paradigm with grating patterns of low to high spatial frequency presented at short and long durations. Linear mixed-effects models were used to examine differences in log CS with respect to group, duration, and stimulus condition. Lower CSs were found in patients compared to controls over all stimulus conditions with the magnitude of deficits dependent on both spatial frequency and stimulus duration. Log CSs to low and high spatial frequencies loaded onto separate principal components, supporting the existence of two psychophysical mechanisms, transient and sustained. Critical conditions were identified to tap each mechanism. Visual acuity was correlated moderately with log CS to high, but not low, spatial frequencies, and deficits found for acuity and CS to moderate/high spatial frequencies (4-21 cycles/degree) appear to reflect dysfunction in the sustained mechanism. CS deficits found at the lowest spatial frequency tested (0.5 cycles/degree) appear to reflect dysfunction in the transient mechanism. Both types of CS deficits may have diagnostic value and implications for social and neurocognitive deficits in this disorder.",
