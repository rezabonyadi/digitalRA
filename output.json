		"abstract": "concepts or show the results of a process, such notions as concept and process are better handled with verbal description.” In an American Cartographer review of the Atlas of Early American History, University of Toronto Geography professors W.J. Eccles,W. G. Dean, G. J. Matthews, and Thomas F. McIlwraith criticized the “application-neutral” approach, or at least questioned its dominance in an atlas that claimed a partly interpretative purpose. They asserted that in the “struggle between thematic and encyclopedic interests...the distributional patterns of selected data sets have been suppressed by maps showing only the existence of a feature and nothing of its spatial relations. Displaying one phenomenon at a time, map by map, is strong evidence that we are dealing with a catalogue, or directory.” They added, “Interpretative maps carefully conceived can tell long stories and guide the reader in a novel learning experience.” Petchenik replied in American Cartographer (1978) that “...users should not have to work around an imposed point of view...”. She maintained, for example, that reference maps that separately plotting the trading posts of competing fur companies are more useful to a scholar than a single thematic map that forces a theme of “conflict” by locating all the posts in one presentation. McIlwraith continued the American Cartographer exchange in 1979: “Historical atlases, and indeed all atlases, are both reference works and interpretations, with the degree of emphasis on one facet or the other, subject to enormous variation.....Mapmakers introduce interpretations into their thematic maps by their choice of subject material, class intervals, and scale.....As long as patterns and interpretations are inevitable aspects of historical mapping, it seems wise to embrace them fully. Readers must, of course, be able to extract the factual basis of maps and then be encouraged to use it for building up their own interpretation. Happily, catering to both aspects simultaneously is quite feasible.” McIlwraith asserted that superimposing different themes over a map can build “graphic literacy” by identifying associations between them, and that a “spatial sense for what thematic maps can show is a prerequisite for the intellectual challenge a map can offer.” He agreed with Petchenik that “a few carefully composed statements of what to notice on a particular map could carry an interested user beyond the basic facts to a new level of awareness of how society has evolved.” The discussion over reference and thematic atlases has even more bearing in the context of education in the lower grades, where perhaps the primary goal is to stimulate and hold the students’ interest. North Carolina State University Professor of Design Denis Wood wrote in a special 1987 school atlas issue of Cartographica, “thinking about atlases as places to look up facts, instead of as things to read, has blinded us to our own cartographic tradition.” Wood maintained that the purpose of an atlas should be to “make something greater that any single map can be; to, through the inter-relatedness of the maps, through their juxtaposition and sequencing, make something higher, something that no individual map could aspire to...create a discourse, a mediation, to tell a story.” He observed that atlases created merely as tools for locating information often fail to recognize why readers are drawn to atlases in the first place. Wood wrote that that readers can derive pleasure in poring over maps, much like they can enjoy landscape paintings, or can use thematic maps as representations of engaging stories, much like they read mystery novels. Castner agreed in the same Cartographica issue that many reference atlases “reinforce an idea that maps serve essentially as repositories of information, i.e., as spatial dictionaries. Without any other experiences, this singular exposure to geographic thinking may be in part responsible for the very limited (and certainly simplistic) view of the nature of geography and cartography which is held by much of the general public. In contrast, I suggest that the real intellectual excitement of geography lies in the complexity of the subject, in the challenge of visualizing these complexities....All this we might call ‘geographic thinking’; it has a strong analytical component as well as a descriptive one.” As an educational project, Wisconsin’s Past and Present: A Historical Atlas was conceived as an atlas very firmly placed on the thematic end of the spectrum. Its purpose was not simply to provide a catalogue of Wisconsin historical sites or county data, but to draw in the readers’ interest with new visual angles and associations of diverse themes. The Guild consciously sought to avoid an image of a reference atlas that would simply sit on a shelf rather than inspire a student to dig deeper into Wisconsin history. Yet the merits of reference maps were also not completely lost on Guild cartographers. They incorporated an “application-neutral” state base map in the front of the book, and numerous tables of elections and other data that were largely left to the reader to interpret. Text accompanying Atlas maps pointed out particular patterns on maps that merited a closer look, based on one or two historical lessons that could be extracted from the map data. Yet the text writers also (partly for a lack of space) sought to avoid overkill in interpreting maps. The text did not seek to spell out all the possible interpretations of a map, or highlight every detail that might contain thematic implications. The reader is free to identify patterns that are not part of the central theme of the text, or even to see areas that do not fit the Guild interpretation. By juxtaposing different data on a map, and juxtaposing different maps in the same book, the Atlas enabled readers to extract their own lessons. Though the goal of the Atlas project was clearly “application-specific,” the effect of some maps and charts may prove to be “application-neutral”—providing resources that can be used to bolster differing views of Wisconsin history. The beauty of an educational atlas, as Castner wrote, is that it can take “an educational approach that looks at more than one possible solution to a question.“ This more balanced strategy may assuage Petchenik’s justified fear of an imposed thematic viewpoint. Having reviewed the past lessons of Wisconsin historical literature, previous state historical atlases, and the general purpose of historical atlases, the Guild undertook to design the format of Wisconsin’s Past and Present: A Historical Atlas. Guild members viewed the format of the atlas, instead of being simply a way to arrange information on a page, as being critical to the development of a “user-friendly” publication. ATLAS ORGANIZATION Format decisions. The earliest Guild objective was to produce an atlas that is modern and provocative in its design and style, using a format that would be both compelling and understandable to the general public. Early in the project, Guild members made two key decisions. First, they decided that the Atlas would be a map-intensive presentation, using photographs, illustrations and other graphics to supplement historical data on the maps. They wanted to stake a middle ground between the text-heavy approach of most scholarly works on Wisconsin history, and the photograph-intensive approach of coffee-table books and many illustrated atlases. Second, they decided that the Atlas presentations would be made on facing two-page spreads. In the Atlas itself, a spread format allows for an interplay of text, maps and other graphics, and a single visual impact. By using a two-page spread format, self-contained Atlas spreads could also be converted for use as educational ancillary materials, such as posters, overhead transparencies, and eventually CD-ROM. (The Office of School Services of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin has expressed interest in developing an Atlas Teacher’s Kit, both for explaining maps to students, and to use the Atlas itself to train teachers in Wisconsin history.) The format and layout of the spreads was largely developed by Guild member Laura Exner, who had extensive experience in page design. Her layout scheme integrated text and graphics into distinct blocs on a 9-by-12 inch page, in order to give each spread a clean and consistent look. The flexibility of how to arrange these blocs, however, allowed spreads to appear different from each other—avoiding the repetitious look of some other state historical atlases. Each Guild member coordinated a certain number of spreads. The use of text, maps, and other graphics in a single presentation allowed them to select the most appropriate vehicle for imparting key information. If a concept was too visually overwhelming on a map, or not spatial enough to present on a map, it could be explained in text or shown as a photograph or chart illustration. Conversely, if a list of place names proved too cumbersome for the text, the places could be plotted instead on a map. Maps and charts could be used to illustrate the central theme of a spread, or could be used as reference tools (for example, a reader might find a chart of elections useful even in isolation from the explanatory text or maps). The first element of the spread was the main body of text, called the “overview.” It was conceived of as a basic review of the primary theme of the spread, presented in chronological order. It often explained the maps and other graphics on the spread, and served as a theme “primer” that could stand alone. The overview covered the highlights of the theme, to provide necessary context to the visual elements. The overview was in 10-point Times type, within two 3-inch columns which could jump from the first page to the second page of the spread. The second element of the spread was the “insight column,” which offered a personal angle on history, through telling an interesti",

		"title": "CLASSIFYING SEGMENTED MULTITEMPORAL SAR DATA FROM AGRICULTURAL AREAS USING SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES",
		"abstract": "In the presented study the performance of support vector machines (SVM) for classifying segmented multi-temporal SAR data is investigated. Results show that multi-temporal SAR data from an area dominated by agriculture can be successfully classified using SVM. Classification accuracy (78.2%) and degree of differentiation between land cover types is similar or better than results achieved with a decision tree classifier. A positive influence of image segmentation on classification results can be reported which varies with object size. A comparison of classification results derived on different aggregation levels shows, that a medium segment size should be preferred. It is better to work with segments that are smaller than the natural features of interest and segments that are greater than natural features should be avoided. INTRODUCTION Land cover classifications are one of the widest used applications in the field of remote sensing. Supervised classification techniques are often used in this context. Besides the chosen classification algorithm, the set of training samples as well as the input images or input features are dominating factors for the accuracy and performance of a supervised classifier (i,ii). The availability of both ground truth data and remote sensing imagery are often limited and can not be influenced by the user. In addition neither the training samples nor the selected features can be assumed to be ideal for a representative training. Against this background, the choice of an adequate classification approach is an important step in data analysis. Regions with agricultural land use are investigated in many remote sensing based land cover studies. Mono-temporal approaches can be inefficient due to great temporal variability of individual plots. In several studies the classification accuracy is increased by multi-temporal data sets (iii,iv). Thus multi-temporal applications seem more appropriate for land cover classifications. However, the availability of optical data is often limited by solar illumination and cloud cover. This is a drawback, particularly for operational monitoring systems. Hence SAR data, which are independent from these factors, are better suited for multi-temporal applications. In regard to upcoming missions with high revisit times and better spatial resolutions like TerraSAR-X, multi-temporal approaches become even more interesting. Considering such future datasets with high spatial and temporal resolution adequate classifiers are needed. Statistical methods like the maximum likelihood classification are widely known. They can achieve good results, if an adequate data distribution model is known (v). In the context of many remote sensing applications a Gaussian distribution of the data is assumed; admittedly such an assumption is not necessarily met and the approach might in many cases be inefficient. Hence non-parametric approaches, like self-learning decision trees (DT) or support vector machines (SVM) have been introduced (ii,vi,vii,viii). The concept of SVMs is well known in pattern recognition and has lead to good results in several remote sensing studies for the classification of optical data (vii,viii). In contrast to other non-parametric methods only a few studies are known that use the approach for classifying SAR data (ix,x). In several studCenter for Remote Sensing of Land Surfaces, Bonn, 28-30 September 2006 49 ies segment based classifications outperform per-pixel approaches (xi,xii). This seems particularly interesting in regard to the SAR typical noise. In addition, image segmentation can reduce the physical size of the data set and hence processing times (xiv) – a relevant issue in regard to high resolution time series. In the presented study the applicability of SVM for the classification of multi-temporal SAR data is investigated. Different levels of image segmentation are generated and classified without using any segment specific features like segment size, shape etc., to investigate the impact of generalization as conducted during the segmentation process on the SVM performance and classification accuracy. The results of the SVMs are compared to classification results achieved by self-learning decision trees. DATA SET AND PREPROCESSING The nearly flat study site is located near Bonn, in the German state North Rhine-Westphalia. The area is dominated by agriculture and characterized by typical spatial patterns and temporal variation caused by differences in the crop phenology. The field plot size varies between approximately 3 and 5 ha, with cereals and sugar beets being the main crops. A dataset of 14 images from 9 acquisition dates, containing 5 Envisat ASAR alternating polarization and 4 ERS-2 precision images was used (Table 1). Thus, the data set comprised information from varying phenological stages and different polarizations. In addition, a Landsat 5 TM image was available, which was used for the image segmentation. A map from a detailed field survey was used for generating the training and validation sample sets. An orthorectification of the Landsat image was performed, using a digital elevation model. The SAR imagery was calibrated to backscatter intensity following a common procedure. Subsequently all data sets were co-registered and an enhanced Frost filter was applied to reduce the speckle. Finally the SAR images were orthorectified using a digital elevation model, orbit parameters and the corrected Landsat image as reference data set. Table 1: Multi-temporal SAR Data set Sensor Date Track / Swath Polarization Orbit ASAR 12-Apr-05 6208 HH / HV asc ERS-2 21-Apr-05 337 VV des ERS-2 26-May-05 337 VV des ERS-2 30-Jun-05 337 VV des ASAR 13-Jul-05 3029 HH / HV asc ASAR 22-Jul-05 7158 HH / HV asc ERS-2 4-Aug-05 337 VV des ASAR 14-Aug-05 2487 HH / HV asc ASAR 18-Sep-05 2487 HH / HV asc Although several segmentation methods have been developed for SAR data, segmentation is still difficult due to the speckle. Outlines derived from optical data seem more appropriate (xv). Hence a segmentation of the Landsat image was performed. Afterwards the segment outlines were transferred onto the SAR data set. Several techniques for image segmentation of optical data sets exist (xvi,xvii,xviii). Region-growing methods assume that pixels of the same natural feature have a certain spectral homogeneity. In this study the commonly available region-growing approach by Baatz and Schäpe (xvii) was used. In the initial phase of the process, pixels are handled as individual segments, which are iteratively merged into larger segments. Candidate pairs of adjacent segments are found by local mutual best fitting. The difference between the heterogeneity of a possible new segment compared to that of its two constituent segments is used as a stopping criterion for the region-growing. If it exceeds a user defined value, the growing process stops. In the presented Proceedings of the 2 Workshop of the EARSeL SIG on Land Use and Land Cover 50 study only the spectral information was used to estimate the segments’ heterogeneity. In doing so the segments were not constrained to any pre-defined shape. To investigate the impact of the segmentation on classification accuracy three different image segmentations were generated. By computing each of the three aggregation levels (scale 1-3) separately, all segmentations were independent from the prior result. The average segment size of scale 1 was 10 pixels (~0.9 ha), of scale 2 25(~2.2 ha) and 65 of scale 3 (~5.8 ha). Figure 1: Landsat 5 TM (4,3,2) and multi-temporal SAR images with segment outlines from TM data. Average segment size 10 pixels, 25 pixels and 65 pixels (from left to right). METHODS SVM delineate two classes by fitting an optimal separating hyperplane to the multidimensional feature space. This optimization bases on structural risk minimization and tries to maximize the margin between the hyperplane and the closest training data points, the socalled support vectors. Thus, SVM only consider training samples close to the class boundary and might work well with small sample sets (xix). For linearly not separable classes the input data are mapped into a high dimensional space wherein the newly spread data point distribution enables the fitting of a linear hyperplane. A detailed description on the general concept of SVM is given in Vapnik (xx) and Burges (xxi). Comprehensive introductions in a remote sensing context are given by Huang et al. (vii) or Foody & Mathur (viii). The binary nature of the SVM requires a useful strategy to solve a multi-class problem (viii). Two main approaches exist: the one-against-one strategy (OAO) and the one-against-all strategy (OAA). OAO applies a set of individual classifiers to all possible pairs of classes and performs a majority vote to assign the winning class. In the case of OAA, a set of binary classifiers is trained to separate each class from the rest. The maximum decision value determines the final class label. In this work, the OAO strategy was performed. A Gauss kernel was used for the training of the SVM. The training parameters were set following the leaveone-out cross validation approach Looms by Lee & Lin (xxii). For the generation of training and validation data sets an extensive ground truth campaign was conducted in summer 2005. A training data set can be generated in different ways: e.g. simple random sampling, systematic sampling or stratified random sampling. Using the first Center for Remote Sensing of Land Surfaces, Bonn, 28-30 September 2006 51 method, each sample has an equal chance to be selected, the systematic approach selects samples with an equal interval over the study area. Stratified random sampling combines a priori knowledge about a study area – like land cover information – with the simple random sampling approach (xxiii). Using land cover classes as a priori knowledge, the stratified random sampling guarantees, that all classes are included in the sample set. I",

		"abstract": "A reinforcer is a stimulus presented closely following a response which res ults in a future increase in frequency of that response. In an ideal applied setting, a stimulus should b e presented immediately. But, it may not always be possible to present stimuli immediately in the a pplied setting. The current study compares the effects of consequence delivery delivered immediately to consequences delayed by five seconds. Three typically developing males, ages 25-30 participated in vi sualisual matching tasks using arbitrary stimuli. Half of the stimuli were always presented with im mediate consequences, while the other half was only followed by delayed consequences. Participants quickly achiev ed mastery of the matching tasks when consequences were immediate, but did not achieve quick master y (within five sessions) when consequences were delayed by five seconds. These results support the ac cept d wisdom that immediate consequences are always best for skill acquisition and that high trea tment integrity is crucial. Additionally, it provides an example of adapting basic research practice s for use in applied contexts. Delayed Consequence Delivery 5 Delayed Consequence Delivery in Applied Settings: Examining Unsignaled Feed back Delays in VisualVisual Matching Tasks Individuals diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) often present deficiencies in responding in three areas of typical human development (DSM-IV, 2000). Firs t, these individuals do not respond to social stimuli with the same regularity that their typical pee rs might. Second, it is often difficult or impossible for people diagnosed with ASDs to communicate effect ively without environmental assistance in the form of picture exchange systems or speech-generating devices. Finally, individuals with ASDs often demonstrate highly restricted or repetiti v interests in specific kinds of stimulation, and this interest often leads to self-stimulatory behavior such as motor stereotypy. When taken together, these three challenges result in individuals wh o may only learn new functional skills though very precisely controlled teaching strategies. Clinicians have found great success when using the application of the principles of behavior analysis in the treatment of t hese individuals, in particular the use of the principle of reinforcement. Properly defined, reinforcement occurs when a stimulus presented or remove d sh rtly following a response results in an increase in the probability of the occurrenc e of that response (Skinner, 1953). Thus, clinicians have used stimuli demonstrated to have a reinforcing effect for the behavior of individuals with whom they are working to increase desirable, functional behavior. Though this principle is widely used, there is one aspect of the definition which does not escape some measure of subj ctivity. That is, a reinforcing stimulus must be changed closely following the targeted response. At present, the conventional wisdom among clinicians has determined that it is best if closely following was equal to immediately following for the purposes of effective behavioral shaping. However, clinical prac tice is typically not automated. Teachers are not as precise with regard s to the time of delivery as food hoppers connected to mechanical devices or specially calibrated timing switc hes. Consequences may often be delivered as immediately as possible, though at other times it may be pre ceded by a time delay. This time Delayed Consequence Delivery 6 delay could be as short as 1 or 2 seconds, or could be as long as 10 seconds or more in som e treatment settings. When faced with a population which has difficulty attending cont inuously to instruction and may be actively engaging in self-stimulatory behavior, such delays may interfere with learning. Lattal (2010), presented an extensive overview of how delay of reinfo cement has been studied with respect to its effects on the operant behavior of animal subjects . In this overview, the author attempts to answer three main questions. First, can the effects of the temporal relation between response and reinforcer be isolated from other environmental changes which accom pany delays? Lattal suggests that they can, as long as the delays are relatively short, on the order of a few seconds. If delayed longer than a few seconds the effect becomes indistinguishable from an absenc e of response-reinforcer dependency. Second, what effect do delays have on operant behavior? Researc h, a noted by Lattal, has found that delays can reduce the effectiveness of response shaping, can induce response differentiation in the absence of effective response training, and can reduce the accuracy a nd rate of responses already established through immediate reinforcement. Third, how can we effectiv ely interpret delay of reinforcement effects? Lattal emphasizes that delay to rein fo cement both imposes contingencies and is imposed by contingencies. Because it is hard to separate temporal contiguity f rom he effects of a reinforcement schedule, it may be best to consider delay to reinforce ment in terms of how it affects behavior. Lattal also describes several variations in how delay to reinf orcement procedures can be implemented. Delays can be either signaled or unsignaled. If a delay is un signaled, there is no stimulus change indicating that a delay is going to take place. Also, delays can be eit her fixed or variable. A fixed delay remains constant throughout a given study, and variable delays are po tentially different for each trial. Finally, delays can be resetting or nonresetting. A resetting dela y is one in which the delay period starts over if any target response occurs during the prescribed delay. N onresetting delays terminate at a predetermined interval regardless of subject responding during that s ame period. Delayed Consequence Delivery 7 Throughout the basic behavioral literature, assessments have been conduct ed with animals to assess some of the effects that delays of reinforcement have on behavi or (Arbuckle & Lattal, 1988; Keeley, Feola, & Lattal, 2007; Odom, Ward, Burke, & Barnes, 2006; Pierce, Ha nford, & Zimmerman, 1972; Royalty, Williams, & Fantino, 1987; Wilkenfield, Nickel, Blakely, & P oling, 1993). In particular, Williams (1976) examined the effects of delayed reinforcer deliver y on the lever-pressing behavior of pigeon subjects. In this study, pecks were reinforced according to a variab le-interval schedule. Then, a delay-of-reinforcement contingency was added onto the schedule, in which a period of un-signaled delay was added following the target response. Behavior was reduced signifi cantly in strength even with just a 3-s delay between response and consequence. Additionally, several studies using animal subjects have incorporat ed multiple schedules and differing values of fixed-time components to examine the effects of res ponding when non-contiguous with consequence delivery. In Sizemore and Lattal (1977), the authors used a yoke -control procedure to assess the differences between response-dependent reinforcement sche dule and response-independent reinforcement schedules. Their data suggest that differences in r ates of responding by pigeons were not entirely due to differences in reinforcer distribution, but were rathe influenced by the non-contiguous nature of their reinforcer delivery. In Sizemore and Lattal (1978), the authors again used tandem variable-inte rval fix d-time schedules with pigeons. The duration of the fixed-time component of the schedul e was varied to assess the effects of unsignaled delays. As the length of the delay was increase d, the pigeons’ response rates decreased. This suggests a weakening of the response reinforcer con tingency and the contiguity between the two was also weakened. Animal studies have shown that the less an absolute delay between res po se and consequences the less the variability of responding for rat and pigeon subjects. If hese studies were to be replicated with human participants, behavior analysts could use the results to make more specific claims about the Delayed Consequence Delivery 8 principle of reinforcement with regards to its application to t he applied setting. The results would add to the growing field of translational research which utilizes the concl usions derived through basic research to the clinical problems of applied behavior analysis, particularly those regarding losses of treatment integrity. One such study, Okouchi (2009), used undergraduate students as partic ipants, and reinforced specific response sequences using a point economy. This study suggested that typically developing adults should be able to acquire a target response under a sizable consequence delay of 1 0 s or more. Treatment Integrity is defined as the extent to which an independent var iable is implemented as intended (Peterson, Homer, & Wonderlich, 1982). There are many ways in which the trea ment integrity of clinical intervention may be less than adequate in applied settings whe re the diagnosis and treatment of problem behavior is the primary goal of practitioners. Behavior programs m ay not be correctly implemented by all direct care staff, operational definitions may be too ge neral, consequences may be delivered inconsistently for target behavior, data collected by direc t care staff may be unreliable, and staff training insufficient for optimal performance. Additionally, without c onsistent supervision and feedback the behavior of caretakers may not conform to contingencies prescribed by be havioral specialists (Vollmer, Sloman, & Pipkin, 2008). One crucial aspect of maintaining high treatment integrity is to en sur the prompt and reliable delivery of reinforcers, as prescribed in behavioral guidelines. Inconsist e cy of reinforcer delivery may be a particularly troubling threat to validity in treatment scenarios in which adaptive skills and alternative responses to problem behavior are being taught to a developmentall",

Workshop on “New and Emerging Technologies in Assistive Robotics” – IROS 2011 San Francisco, California, September 26, 2011 SULTAN: SIMULTANEOUS USER LEARNING AND TASK EXECUTION, AND ITS APPLICATION IN ASSISTIVE ROBOTICS C. Balaguer , A. Jardón , C.A. Monje , F. Bonsignorio , M.F. Stoelen , S. Martínez , J.G. Victores A a RoboticsLab, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Spain b Heron Robots, Genova, Italy INTRODUCTION The main objective of this work is to present a mechanism called Simultaneous User Learning and TAsk executioN (SULTAN). In SULTAN the model of the user maintained by the system's learning module and the system's representation of the physical interaction tasks are concurrently refined (in analogy with SLAM), keeping explicit account of the user's own learning. The process is as such seen as a mutual adaptation learning process. It aims to augment the users' ability to perform daily tasks by a new concept of intelligent service robotic system capable of physical and cognitive collaboration. One of the potential applications is in assistive robotics (see Figure 1), and the main focus is on creating a human+robot binomial in which: a) the robotic system will use, not ignore, the human perception and cognitive abilities in order to safely achieve the tasks that would be too complex to perform in a purely autonomous way, and b) the human will not be a mere teleoperator of the robot but will take advantage of the acquired knowledge of the robotic system to augment her/his action and perception capabilities. THE SULTAN CONCEPT The SULTAN learning process is based on hierarchical Bayesian networks [2,3,4]. Building on the Bayesian Approach to Cognitive System (BACS) EU project, see for example [5], a probability is assigned to all possible interpretations of the available human+robot sensory and motor information, on the basis of sensory or motor noise and priors designating the most likely interpretation. The motor output (following a Robot Parametric Path, RPP, a parameterized and probabilistical representation of a given task) corresponds to the interpretation that has the most probable, or the most desirable, outcome. The SULTAN concept sets the problem in a user-task-object domain to solve the challenge of how to robustly perform a set of tasks for different users in different environments by the same robot, see Figure 2. For example, a situation where a user (Martin) commands the robotic system to perform a specific task (pick) with a specific object (can), using the user's perception abilities (eye tracking) and his satisfaction index (quality of the path). The storyline of the SULTAN system begins with the KDB (Knowledge Data Base) empty, except for some information of the robot and the user. During the first stage of SULTAN the user moves the robot in a fully teleoperated mode, using his/her knowledge and his/her perception, and interacting with the real world. The KDB is learning by the continuous updating of the RPPs parameters. While the user repeats the tasks, the robot's control changes from fully teleoperated to semi-autonomous mode with less and less intervention of the user. Some of the Figure 1. ASIBOT robot [1] working with a user in a real kitchen environment. Figure 2. The SULTAN dimensional relationships. Workshop on “New and Emerging Technologies in Assistive Robotics” – IROS 2011 San Francisco, California, September 26, 2011 parts of the RPP will be executed in a fully autonomous way. When the number of tasks is sufficient and the RPP parameters adjustment is finished, the robot can move fully autonomously using its own perception and control system and the updated KDB. The users only supervise the system. This process will be repeated for different users (Peter-pick-can), different tasks (Martin-hold-can) and different objects (Martin-pick-bottle), this way creating the full KDB. At this point the storyline is finished and the robot will work with a certain degree of autonomy. FIRST IMPLEMENTATION The scope of the software architecture required for realizing SULTAN ranges from high (user interactionlevel) to low (hardware interaction-level) aspects of design. The multimodal interaction will be interpreted at a semantic level and used to plan a desired task. This process uses information that has been collected from the environment and the knowledge that exists about a given user (in the before-mentioned KDB). A learning agent generates this knowledge by observing the user inputs, task progress and contextual information, simultaneously learning with the user. The generated task is performed and monitored using information from the external sensors and the robot's own propioceptive sensors. Benchmarks for human performance on typical DLAs are being established. See for example the trajectories for two users (without disability) performing simplified DLAs in a virtual environment in Figure 3. These benchmarks can be used to put the performance of the human+robot binomial in perspective and to aid in the design of shared control and intent recognition capabilities. A pilot study was also performed, in the same environment, to investigate the adaptation of the interaction for a robot capable of providing physical assistance to disabled users. The subjects were three non-disabled users. A simple shared control scheme was implemented, which limits the velocity of the end-effector commanded by the user in the direction where obstacles are detected, proportionally to the distance measured. All sessions, except the control session, had Gaussian noise added which was low-pass filtered at 2 Hz and which increased in magnitude proportionally with the magnitude of the velocity commanded by the user. As it can be seen from Figure 4, the noise added did seem to have a negative effect of the performance of the subjects. The average Mean Time (MT) over subjects was increased from 6.15 to 10.04 seconds. This was seen even clearer in the predictive information metric, I(At;At+1), the mutual information across the shared control output (A) at subsequent moments in time [6]. This indicates this metric’s sensitivity to the reduction in the “predictability” of the trajectories with the noise added. The shared control had a positive effect, reducing MT to 7.43 seconds. This improvement was seen also in the other two metrics, especially in the mutual information across the noise added, Z, and the shared control output, i.e. I(Zt;At). CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we have presented the novel SULTAN concept as a mechanism that allows the augmentation of personal capabilities to perform daily tasks through the creation of a human+robot binomial in which physical and cognitive collaboration is achieved as a whole. The novelty of this approach is discussed and in order to demonstrate the applicability of the SULTAN idea, the first experimental results from its implementation have been given. Further research will focus on the implementation of the complete SULTAN architecture, closing the loops between all its levels and integrating it in different robotic systems, including assistive robots.

		"abstract": "A reinforcer is a stimulus presented closely following a response which res ults in a future increase in frequency of that response. In an ideal applied setting, a stimulus should b e presented immediately. But, it may not always be possible to present stimuli immediately in the a pplied setting. The current study compares the effects of consequence delivery delivered immediately to consequences delayed by five seconds. Three typically developing males, ages 25-30 participated in vi sualisual matching tasks using arbitrary stimuli. Half of the stimuli were always presented with im mediate consequences, while the other half was only followed by delayed consequences. Participants quickly achiev ed mastery of the matching tasks when consequences were immediate, but did not achieve quick master y (within five sessions) when consequences were delayed by five seconds. These results support the ac cept d wisdom that immediate consequences are always best for skill acquisition and that high trea tment integrity is crucial. Additionally, it provides an example of adapting basic research practice s for use in applied contexts. Delayed Consequence Delivery 5 Delayed Consequence Delivery in Applied Settings: Examining Unsignaled Feed back Delays in VisualVisual Matching Tasks Individuals diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) often present deficiencies in responding in three areas of typical human development (DSM-IV, 2000). Firs t, these individuals do not respond to social stimuli with the same regularity that their typical pee rs might. Second, it is often difficult or impossible for people diagnosed with ASDs to communicate effect ively without environmental assistance in the form of picture exchange systems or speech-generating devices. Finally, individuals with ASDs often demonstrate highly restricted or repetiti v interests in specific kinds of stimulation, and this interest often leads to self-stimulatory behavior such as motor stereotypy. When taken together, these three challenges result in individuals wh o may only learn new functional skills though very precisely controlled teaching strategies. Clinicians have found great success when using the application of the principles of behavior analysis in the treatment of t hese individuals, in particular the use of the principle of reinforcement. Properly defined, reinforcement occurs when a stimulus presented or remove d sh rtly following a response results in an increase in the probability of the occurrenc e of that response (Skinner, 1953). Thus, clinicians have used stimuli demonstrated to have a reinforcing effect for the behavior of individuals with whom they are working to increase desirable, functional behavior. Though this principle is widely used, there is one aspect of the definition which does not escape some measure of subj ctivity. That is, a reinforcing stimulus must be changed closely following the targeted response. At present, the conventional wisdom among clinicians has determined that it is best if closely following was equal to immediately following for the purposes of effective behavioral shaping. However, clinical prac tice is typically not automated. Teachers are not as precise with regard s to the time of delivery as food hoppers connected to mechanical devices or specially calibrated timing switc hes. Consequences may often be delivered as immediately as possible, though at other times it may be pre ceded by a time delay. This time Delayed Consequence Delivery 6 delay could be as short as 1 or 2 seconds, or could be as long as 10 seconds or more in som e treatment settings. When faced with a population which has difficulty attending cont inuously to instruction and may be actively engaging in self-stimulatory behavior, such delays may interfere with learning. Lattal (2010), presented an extensive overview of how delay of reinfo cement has been studied with respect to its effects on the operant behavior of animal subjects . In this overview, the author attempts to answer three main questions. First, can the effects of the temporal relation between response and reinforcer be isolated from other environmental changes which accom pany delays? Lattal suggests that they can, as long as the delays are relatively short, on the order of a few seconds. If delayed longer than a few seconds the effect becomes indistinguishable from an absenc e of response-reinforcer dependency. Second, what effect do delays have on operant behavior? Researc h, a noted by Lattal, has found that delays can reduce the effectiveness of response shaping, can induce response differentiation in the absence of effective response training, and can reduce the accuracy a nd rate of responses already established through immediate reinforcement. Third, how can we effectiv ely interpret delay of reinforcement effects? Lattal emphasizes that delay to rein fo cement both imposes contingencies and is imposed by contingencies. Because it is hard to separate temporal contiguity f rom he effects of a reinforcement schedule, it may be best to consider delay to reinforce ment in terms of how it affects behavior. Lattal also describes several variations in how delay to reinf orcement procedures can be implemented. Delays can be either signaled or unsignaled. If a delay is un signaled, there is no stimulus change indicating that a delay is going to take place. Also, delays can be eit her fixed or variable. A fixed delay remains constant throughout a given study, and variable delays are po tentially different for each trial. Finally, delays can be resetting or nonresetting. A resetting dela y is one in which the delay period starts over if any target response occurs during the prescribed delay. N onresetting delays terminate at a predetermined interval regardless of subject responding during that s ame period. Delayed Consequence Delivery 7 Throughout the basic behavioral literature, assessments have been conduct ed with animals to assess some of the effects that delays of reinforcement have on behavi or (Arbuckle & Lattal, 1988; Keeley, Feola, & Lattal, 2007; Odom, Ward, Burke, & Barnes, 2006; Pierce, Ha nford, & Zimmerman, 1972; Royalty, Williams, & Fantino, 1987; Wilkenfield, Nickel, Blakely, & P oling, 1993). In particular, Williams (1976) examined the effects of delayed reinforcer deliver y on the lever-pressing behavior of pigeon subjects. In this study, pecks were reinforced according to a variab le-interval schedule. Then, a delay-of-reinforcement contingency was added onto the schedule, in which a period of un-signaled delay was added following the target response. Behavior was reduced signifi cantly in strength even with just a 3-s delay between response and consequence. Additionally, several studies using animal subjects have incorporat ed multiple schedules and differing values of fixed-time components to examine the effects of res ponding when non-contiguous with consequence delivery. In Sizemore and Lattal (1977), the authors used a yoke -control procedure to assess the differences between response-dependent reinforcement sche dule and response-independent reinforcement schedules. Their data suggest that differences in r ates of responding by pigeons were not entirely due to differences in reinforcer distribution, but were rathe influenced by the non-contiguous nature of their reinforcer delivery. In Sizemore and Lattal (1978), the authors again used tandem variable-inte rval fix d-time schedules with pigeons. The duration of the fixed-time component of the schedul e was varied to assess the effects of unsignaled delays. As the length of the delay was increase d, the pigeons’ response rates decreased. This suggests a weakening of the response reinforcer con tingency and the contiguity between the two was also weakened. Animal studies have shown that the less an absolute delay between res po se and consequences the less the variability of responding for rat and pigeon subjects. If hese studies were to be replicated with human participants, behavior analysts could use the results to make more specific claims about the Delayed Consequence Delivery 8 principle of reinforcement with regards to its application to t he applied setting. The results would add to the growing field of translational research which utilizes the concl usions derived through basic research to the clinical problems of applied behavior analysis, particularly those regarding losses of treatment integrity. One such study, Okouchi (2009), used undergraduate students as partic ipants, and reinforced specific response sequences using a point economy. This study suggested that typically developing adults should be able to acquire a target response under a sizable consequence delay of 1 0 s or more. Treatment Integrity is defined as the extent to which an independent var iable is implemented as intended (Peterson, Homer, & Wonderlich, 1982). There are many ways in which the trea ment integrity of clinical intervention may be less than adequate in applied settings whe re the diagnosis and treatment of problem behavior is the primary goal of practitioners. Behavior programs m ay not be correctly implemented by all direct care staff, operational definitions may be too ge neral, consequences may be delivered inconsistently for target behavior, data collected by direc t care staff may be unreliable, and staff training insufficient for optimal performance. Additionally, without c onsistent supervision and feedback the behavior of caretakers may not conform to contingencies prescribed by be havioral specialists (Vollmer, Sloman, & Pipkin, 2008). One crucial aspect of maintaining high treatment integrity is to en sur the prompt and reliable delivery of reinforcers, as prescribed in behavioral guidelines. Inconsist e cy of reinforcer delivery may be a particularly troubling threat to validity in treatment scenarios in which adaptive skills and alternative responses to problem behavior are being taught to a developmentall",
