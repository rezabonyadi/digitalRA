For researchers!

Provide a paragraph describing an idea, the Digital RA is composed for you with the right skills (overridable by you), performs a paper search for you, estimates the relevance between papers and your idea, picks a subset, and writes a small section of Literature Review for your review and final inclusion in your grant or paper.

MORE: You can chat with the RA about the papers, your ideas, how are they connected, and more.

With `digitalRA`, we aim to simplify the process of literature reviews. By leveraging OpenAI GPT models, we provide researchers a tool that can streamline the discovery of relevant papers, aiding in the comprehensive understanding of a given topic.
